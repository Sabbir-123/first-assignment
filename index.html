            <h2>Their Lives Depend on <br> Your Donation</h2>
            <p>
                Those with money or power often believe that they can do good by filling some need with material things or simply monetary gifts. While in the short term this may be helpful, this kind of aid is ultimately detrimental to the recipients. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When donations of some material are sent to an area, this automatically erases the need to produce or sell the same object locally. This, therefore, is detrimental to local businesses and takes away the opportunity for individual entrepreneurship.

            <h2>They Need Us <br> to Survive</h2>
            <p>
                Charity and donations often help the recipients put a “band-aid” over their true problems. It then causes the recipients to become dependent on aid and inhibit their self sufficiency that they are capable of.   
            </p>
            <p>
                This especially affects the people the most, because with other countries donating items or money, the people are not moving towards the progress of getting out of poverty.
